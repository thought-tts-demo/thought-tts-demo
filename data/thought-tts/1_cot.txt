This speech conveys a sense of discouragement and frustration. Here's a breakdown of the likely emotional tone and delivery: the emotion is despair, defeat, discouragement. The pitch is low to medium.  This reflects the dominant negative emotion. The pitch variation is likely limited, but there could be a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence ("it'll never happen for me"). The loudness is potentially soft to moderate. Given the setting that comes from failure, the loudness could also rise at "it'll never happen for me". The speed could be slightly slower than usual, reflecting the weight of the situation and the effort put forth.
