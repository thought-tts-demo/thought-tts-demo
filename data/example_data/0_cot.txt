The speech segment is characterized by a conversational and slightly informal tone. The use of "uhm" and the repetition of "we had" suggest a slightly hesitant or reflective delivery. The content describes a relatively calm and positive situation ("really, really nice extras"). This suggests a generally calm emotion, possibly with a touch of fondness or nostalgia. The pitch is likely mid-range, not particularly high or low.  The presence of "uhm" suggests some variation in pitch, likely slight dips and rises as the speaker searches for words. The loudness is likely moderate, suitable for a casual recounting. The speed is slightly fast, with pauses and filler word "uhm".
